# OVERVIEW

* service learning
* UMA medicine students
* Profile of students - background, interest
* Project profiles - organizations around the world
* matching student with projects - background, interests, availability
* availability of a student and the time of a project must be in unison

# Q&A

### What info does the platform contain? 
2 sides to that:

Student side - profiles for each student that uses the platform

* academic background,
* subjects of interest
* when are they available to volunteer
* ...

Organization:

* what kind of org it is - ngo / research group, etc.
* what does it do? (school, food for people, clinic, etc)
* evaluation of the organzation by the students that had participated in the service organizaed by them
* UMA has a list of approved organizations (only these orgs can access the platform)
* different people can access the given project (as its admins) to modify it (simultaneous access to the profile)
* (optional) would be nice to collaborate on one project by multiple organizations

+ info about the already participated projects (at the student side and at the org side)

### Credentials
Same as VC: email + password
* email also used as a primarily way of communication (in addition maybe a phone)

### Searching information
**Search engine**
e.g. search for "disabled children", and we get the results

### Use of platform
**Only** for finding organizations. No more.

### How to apply?
* Direct contact to the organization (always) 
* (if possible) application process in the app (or if it's not possible application on organization website) 
* Orgnizations gets the list of all students that applied and they can filter through it (e.g. by skill, by background, etc.) 
* students can withdraw / cancel application

### Who approves organizations?
* Organization's profile is created by the organization itself
* only organization approved by UMA gets the credentials to create its profile

### Restriction for enrollment 
* Only medicine students (for now - but can be extended in future to all students)

### Will some students have priority in applying?
NO

### Evaluation of the organization 
* comment/review on the organization's profile
* reviews from students (basically comments)
* NO STARS ("That seems kinda stupid"). In general - no overall mark, if anything - there can be different rankings for different categories
* Whether giving numerical marks should be possible is up to the designer to decide (perhaps something like different categories, e.g. ranking "cleanliness", "organization", "responsiveness", etc)  
* students are **required** to leave evaluation after completing the activity

### What happens if Number of Students > Number of places ?
* all students can apply and it's left to organization itself to decide who they want to take in
* Organizations can provide the number of places that they have on disposal for the project
* When the organization decides on all the students that they want to take, the listing should disappear without manual intervention 

### Platform expansion to other universities
Cool feature to have in future but not for now
If this happens, it should be possible to narrow search down, e.g. only to the university that the student attends.

### How many projects can a student join?
* **one at a time**
* No official limit

### Project duration
* it's vital that it's included on the project's page

### Where do we leave the comments?
* each student has a unique project "assigned to him" and leaves an evaluation on this project but...
* review should be visible on the organization page and on the project page as well

### Finished projects
* They go to the archive
* Basically project has to be available to everyone, even if it's finished
* Students can search for past projects as well 

### How are students notified of acceptance/rejection?
* by email (but platform should have info about accepted/rejected students)

### How student announces his availability? (just filter by date or is it persisted somehow?)
No answer :(
